# Getting started
Make sure you have the [ionic](https://ionicframework.com/getting-started) installed globally `npm install -g ionic
 cordova`. You can either use npm or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) to manage the dependencies.
- For npm the default package manager, run `npm install` to resolve all dependencies.
- For [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), you can install it from [Here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install), then run `yarn install` to resolve all dependencies. You can also make Yarn the default package manager by running `ionic config set -g yarn true`.

Run `ionic serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ionic cordova run android` to run on your android device. For more information refer to [Documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/deploying/)

# Building the project
- Run `ionic cordova build browser` to build the browser project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `www/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
- Run `ionic cordova build android` to build the android project. This will generate an apk. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
